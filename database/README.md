# Database Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the required database tables in Supabase for the Healthcare App.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New Query" to create a new SQL script

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script
1. Copy the entire content from `database/setup.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the script

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created
After running the script, you should see these tables in your database:
- `mood_entries` - Stores user mood tracking data
- `mood_settings` - User preferences for mood tracking
- `symptom_reports` - User symptom submissions
- `diagnosis_logs` - AI analysis results and recommendations

### Step 4: Add Sample Data (Optional)
To test the mood analytics immediately:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Authentication" â†’ "Users"
3. Copy your user ID (the UUID in the first column)
4. Go back to SQL Editor
5. Uncomment the sample data section at the bottom of `setup.sql`
6. Replace `'your-user-id-here'` with your actual user ID
7. Run the INSERT statements
